Scale and profitability Ai now serves 9 of the top 20 insurers  in the UK, which would appear to be  one of the strengths of your business.  Is there, however, a natural ceiling to  the number of blue chip relationships  you will be able to establish and is  it, therefore, a concern that you may  have reached saturation point in terms  of doing business at the top end of  the market? A. No. Our distribution strategy   enables us to work with all sectors   of the insurance industry as well as   non-insurance sector corporates   whose customers are engaged in a  motor claim. The nature of our system's  infra-structure and expertise in process  management will also enable Ai to  continue to broaden its service offering  to these clients. Q. Strategy You have consistently stated that  the motor insurance market in  the UK is undergoing a period of  significant change in the way that  policyholders are serviced and  third party costs are managed.   Are you developing the breadth  and depth of your own service  offering and, if so, in what ways  are you doing this?  A. Ai has broadened its product  base, innovating new solutions to  the needs of a changing market  place. The ‘Defenda’ product is a  clear example of this and provides  a high benefit to the insurance  market. We are able to operate   in any part of the claims cycle   and are developing this into new  markets such as Broker, Fleet and  Motor Manufacturers. 6 Ai CLAIMS SOLuTIONS PLC  ANNuAL REPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2007",263,4,4,4,9,0,2,0,2,10,3,0,0,2,26,13.621080791867309,53.448286516853955,10.351524879614772,9.254390422685928,9.785826645264848,9.713558052434458,12.964285714285714,6.716835473515248,,17.57,29.62,17.3,8.75,17.4,10.28,16.0,15.7,18.0
8,359,AI CLAIM SOLUTIONS PLC  REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007.pdf,2007,0,AI Claim Solutions Plc,0,1,52,8,8," Q. management During the last two years you have  strengthened your senior management  team and main board with the  addition of some very experienced  people. Do you have plans to  continue to add muscle at the top of  the company, or do you now feel the  business is appropriately resourced in  order to deliver your future plans? A. We have strengthened the team in  the last couple of years at board and  senior management level and this will  continue to enable us to successfully  exploit new opportunities. Q. Investment Ai has invested significantly in new  systems and technology over the last  few years. What capability does it  give you? A. We have invested in our offices  and call centre to create capacity  ahead of volume and provide our  people with a state-of-the-art working  environment. Our current campus  enables us to comfortably grow from  320 to 550 people and our systems  can accommodate over 1,000  concurrent users. We have also recently  completed the build of our new Claims  Administration and Recovery System  (CARS). This uses ‘Service Orientated  Architecture’ (SOA) technology and will  enable us to provide bespoke process  and systems solutions for our partners  using a highly efficient platform.   Our own operation will derive efficiency  and control benefits from the system  through the automation of workflow. Q. Corporate Responsibility We’re moving into an era where the  importance companies place on their  own impact on the environment is  increasingly rising. Have you yet been  able to establish the environmental  credentials of your own company? A. Our first priority was establishing  a response to the use of replacement  vehicles. As we don’t own our own  fleet of vehicles the selection of rental  partner was key. AVIS is the first car  rental company in the world offering  Carbon Neutral driving. AVIS also has  a spread of rental depots which enable  delivery journeys and CO2 emissions  to be considerably reduced when  compared to most of our fleet owning  competitors who operate from relatively  few regional territories. We have also  conducted energy efficiency audits of  our operations. Q. Culture Ai has especially strong cultural  foundations. This has always  been one of the cornerstones of  the business. Your core values of  Partnership, Openness, Responsibility  and Sustainability are well established  within the market place. To what  extent has this culture benefited the  business thus far and what are your  ongoing plans for continuing to  communicate these values to your  stakeholders? A. They are crucial for building trust,  which is absolutely critical for any  business but particularly so when  being entrusted to manage claims  and our referrers' customers when they  are vulnerable. We offer our partners  an open book on what we do and  welcome auditing of our service. Q. looking Forward What are your key priorities for the  coming year and how is the company  going to achieve them? A. We are continuing to invest to  broaden our capability and expertise.  We will continue to innovate new  service solutions in existing and new  distribution channels. We will ensure our  operational performance develops the  financial and service benefits enjoyed  by our partners.  Q. non-ownership of Fleet Why don’t you have your own fleet  and does it create customer hand offs? A. Our core competency is about  managing a broader customer  experience and the presentation and  recovery of a claim – that’s why our  debtor days are 55 compared to over  200 in the sector. Secondly we choose  to work with well branded expertise  who have massive operational scale  and seek to earn a fair return on capital  for the risks they take – we don’t,  therefore, have to worry about residual  values, vehicle utilisation and funding  risks. Finally, there is no more hand off  than any other company – AVIS is our  ‘physically’ in-house fleet department;  after all, the person dealing with the  customer on the phone doesn’t then  deliver the car.

11,359,AI CLAIM SOLUTIONS PLC  REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007.pdf,2007,0,AI Claim Solutions Plc,0,1,52,11,11," The Group has delivered a strong  trading performance, with an  improvement in margin and excellent  cashflow. At the same time, we  have also continued to invest in new  technology and in our team, which  underpin Ai’s development as an  innovative and flexible outsource  provider to the motor claims market. Chairman’s Statement share with its clients the financial rewards that   can be obtained. Ai has consistently taken the  view that it must work seamlessly with and in the  interests of the motor insurance market which it  serves. The thrust of Ai’s whole philosophy is, and  always has been, based on a sustainable and  ethical business model where the interests of all  parties are valued and protected, namely those  of our clients, staff and shareholders. Our ability to collect our debts much more  rapidly than credit hire companies, several of  which are now trying to move into this space,  coupled with the lack of a heavy vehicle fleet  financing cost, which, for some of our competitors  is likely to be aggravated by the current credit  environment, means that we can realise attractive  returns on capital, whilst actively competing   on price. Ai has supported insurers in piloting services  in the non-fault sector and two new relationships  came on stream during the year. We maintain  strong trading relationships with both these  businesses. As a result of the increased penetration of  credit hire within the insurance sector, insurers are  increasingly seeking solutions to stem the increase  in third party claims. We have provided an  intervention product (Reserva, formerly Predicta)  for several years to manage claims proactively  on behalf of insurers, thus avoiding credit hire  costs, and those insurers who use this service find  that it provides a more effective and financially  attractive alternative to in-house claims teams.  During 2007, using our unique and demonstrable  track record of keeping a tight grip on credit hire  periods, we also extended our product range to  include a market leading service ‘Defenda’ which  actively manages credit hire bills, saving insurers  an attractive proportion of invoices submitted  by credit hire companies. This has received a  significant level of interest from insurers and we  are working with 6 leading insurers. Our development of fee based services  continued with the award of a 3 year contract  from one of the uK’s largest fleet operators to  manage the repair of damage to their uK fleet  and recover losses from at fault parties.  Our business principle of delivering excellent  service and cost containment is now widely  recognised in the motor accident market.   Our investment in technology over the last  two years will be realised through the launch  of the new CARS system in October. This will  provide the capability to re-engineer business  processes and rapidly deliver efficient and readily  adaptable workflow based systems solutions for  our referrer clients. Across our whole product range we are  currently working for three top five personal   motor insurers and eight top twenty personal  motor insurers and a further eight clients with  activities in the motor sector generally. management and Board Changes As part of our growth and continuing  development as a significant outsourcer to the  motor insurance sector, we continue to strengthen  the management of Ai at all levels.  Steve Broughton, previously a Non-Executive  Director, was appointed Non-Executive Deputy  Chairman on 26 July 2007 replacing Adrian  Palmer, who remains a Non-Executive Director.  Steve has excellent insurance industry credentials  as a Non-Executive Director of Fortis uK and  formerly as an Executive Director of RSA. Don Bergenroth, who has been a Director  since January 2005, will be retiring from the  business on 30 September 2007, stepping down  from the Board at that time. I would like to thank  Don for his contribution to Ai and wish him well  for the future. Commercial activities will be led by  Chris Brown, who joined Ai as a Director of the  trading subsidiary in June 2007. Chris previously  held senior roles at AXA and RSA. There have been a number of other successful  changes at the operating company level all of  which are designed to enhance and deepen Ai’s  strength and ability to add value across the whole  motor insurance market. dividends The Board is pleased to propose a final dividend  of 0.29p per share for the year to 30 June 2007  to be paid on 7 January 2008 to shareholders  on the register at 14 December 2007, an  increase in the year of 16%, taking total dividends  in respect of 2006 – 07 to 0.52p – also an  increase of 16% over the previous year. Future prospects Ai continues to work closely with the motor sector  in developing innovative solutions bespoked to  the needs of our clients. These provide excellent  service to both them and their customers,  minimisation of cost to the market as a whole  and generate significant financial benefits either  through direct containment of their costs or sharing  of revenue streams according to the type of  service chosen by our clients.  I am pleased with the progress made during  the year and am confident that we can continue  to innovate and deliver value adding services  to the sector. The number of Ai’s products and  services actively in use by insurers and the wider  motor sector has increased from fifteen at the  end of last year to twenty seven at the time of  writing and the current high level of tender activity  from insurers is expected to generate additional  opportunities for Ai. Although the market has  become more competitive, predominantly in  vehicle hire, we expect that our lean operating  and financing structure will assist us in maintaining  our margins. It is a testament to our people and the  commitment shown by them across all levels of  the business that this progress has been achieved  and I pass on my sincere thanks on behalf of   the Directors.  Charles a Good Chairman 10 October 2007 Results Adjusted profit before tax (before goodwill  amortisation and FRS 20 charge) was £1.635m  (2006: £1.452m). As anticipated at the interim,  the result was weighted toward the second half  year, with £1.026m being generated in the  second half year compared with £0.609m   in the first half year. In line with our expectations, turnover  expanded by 32% within the second half  compared to the first half, although it was 10%  lower at £34.3m (2006: £38.0m) for the full  year. Hire turnover increased by 22% compared  with the previous year and repair turnover  reduced by 36% due principally to a change  in contract mix towards higher margin vehicle  replacement services and as a result of pricing  actions. Turnover in the second half increased by  15% compared to the second half of last year.  Our full year gross margin increased from 24.8%  to 30% as a result of these changes and through  the successful establishment of Ai’s own repair  network and dedicated legal service. Our cash generation continued to be strong  with £4m generated from operating activities.  Our debtor days, which we calculate using the  countback method, average 55 days   (2006: 75 days) which compares very  favourably to the sector. Again this is a testament  to the relationship we have with the large  insurance companies and the strategic focus   we have placed on this activity during the year. Net borrowings reduced by £1.9m during  the year, after absorbing £1.5m of capital  expenditure on IT and infra-structure development  to support the growth in headcount and the  final stages of development of the new Claims  Administration and Recovery System (CARS). Strategy There has been real momentum in the non-fault  market, with most insurers now piloting the  provision of like-for-like vehicle replacement.  Insurance company participation in the   non-fault market has provided considerable  growth opportunities for credit hire companies,  albeit at lower margins, and for ourselves.   Ai continues to lead the way in providing   motor insurers and other clients within the  motor sector with a genuine partnership based  approach to outsourcing, bringing not only an  open-book relationship, but a willingness to   10 Ai CLAIMS SOLuTIONS PLC  ANNuAL REPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2007",1325,13,16,18,58,3,48,3,47,66,23,17,14,25,99,19.294771241830066,35.8851797385621,15.459885620915035,10.836176633986927,16.864008169934642,12.162294117647058,21.355555555555554,8.862833333333333,17.429995496436575,20.7,20.99,20.6,8.6,23.5,12.78,13.2,18.6,21.0

The market has moved considerably  during the year and Ai has proven its  ability to innovate new solutions and  services for its clients. Our emphasis  on developing an attractive return on  our capital has shown through in a  significant change in the mix of our  business and strengthening of margins. Chief Executive’s Review Within the insurance sector we commenced  a significant Mobilisa pilot with a major insurer  providing access to approximately 12,000   cases per annum. This pilot has proven to be  very successful and we have extended the  relationship to broaden our service offering  further. Our Defenda product has received   much market interest and we are actively   piloting this with 6 insurers. Our services have  been successful in delivering attractive savings  against the invoices presented from credit hire  companies, adding significant value to those  insurers using this service. Ai’s ability to report   on differences in working practises and invoicing  protocol is proving extremely beneficial to  insurers. Whilst this new product is in its infancy,  only commencing in February this year, it is very  encouraging that so many insurers have found  it so beneficial. We have continued to grow  the intervention service, Reserva, achieving a  30% increase in referrals during the year as new  insurer relationships came on stream. As the credit hire market continues to grow and  develop, Ai’s Reserva and Defenda products and  services will become more attractive to insurers to  assist them in managing excessive claims cost. I am pleased to report that the launch of  Ai Law and Ai Repair Network delivered the  customer and financial benefits anticipated.  Ai became the first motor claims management  company to mandate the new PAS 125 Kitemark  accreditation. AVIS became our strategic rental  partner from 1 November 2006 and I am  pleased with the supply of vehicles and seamless  service achieved. It is a key feature of our service  that customers are placed in new vehicles  delivered by a partner who is a recognised  consumer brand. We completed the build of the new Claims  Administration and Recovery System (CARS) in  June 2007 and it will go live in October 2007.  This system, which has required significant capital  expenditure over the last two years, employs   state of the art 'Open System Architecture'   technology, which will provide us with   the flexibility to rapidly bespoke processes for   our partners and enable full automation with   our financial system.  The development of the insurer placed   non-fault sector will also increase further the cost  of third party claims. This in turn is heightening the  need for more pro-active management of these  costs, whether provided internally or outsourced.  Ai has been working closely with the insurance  sector further to develop the claims intervention  service provided. In response to this challenge,   Ai has relaunched its ‘Predicta’ product as  ‘Reserva’, the product that controls excessive third  party claims costs. We have also introduced  a credit hire defence product, ‘Defenda’,  for instances where the insurer has not been  successful at intervening, which actively manages  the credit hire claim to settlement. This has  generated considerable market interest. Ai continues to actively work with credit hire  operators (CHOs) and insurers on the ABI GTA  Technical Committee to ensure stability and  understanding in the market.  Business and Commercial development  In my last report I indicated that we would  broaden our distribution strategy launching  divisions in the broker, fleet and automotive  sectors. I am pleased to report good headway   in each of these areas. In the fleet sector we won the tender to  manage the claims and repairs of a major fleet.  This requires us to manage 15,000 incidents  culminating in placing an additional 5,000  repairs per annum into our repair network.   We have also recruited a sales team to service  the automotive market and are developing our  referral streams from a low base. Early signs are  very positive in both the fleet and automotive  sectors with strong relationships developing   with manufacturers.  Our broker division has been piloting with   a major uK firm and Ai’s credentials and service  offering are known to the wider intermediary  market. Not surprisingly, much of this sector is  already contracted to CHOs, however Ai is  developing strong relationships and coupled  with our strong commission offers and effective  customer centric model I remain confident of  significant progress in this new area for Ai. market developments The motor insurance market has again been  challenged in terms of delivering acceptable  underwriting returns with premium rates and  acquisition costs being consistent features in the  insurance press. The anticipated development  of insurer interest in using a third party service to  provide like-for-like replacement vehicles to their  not at fault customers has reached its tipping  point and now most insurers are actively piloting  some form of service or have contracted for the  service in some form. As part of Ai’s offer to this  market we have branded this service 'Mobilisa'.  This non fault business is being keenly contested  and margins will be squeezed by the increasing  commission rates or discounts on credit hire  case settlements being sought by insurers and  the typically lower vehicle hire durations. This  ‘income’ effectively subsidises the increase in  third party claims which have also pressurised  underwriting margins.  We believe higher commission levels will  ripple through the non-insurance sector of  the market as contracts are re-tendered or  benchmarked. Ai is well placed to compete  competitively both in the delivery of excellent  service and on price. Our ‘thin capital’ model,  whereby we operate on a relatively small  working capital requirement and without a large  amount of capital tied up in a fleet of vehicles,  means we can achieve attractive returns on  capital whilst being able to price for competitive  operating margins. Ai is well placed to compete competitively  both in the delivery of excellent service and  on price. david Sandhu Chief Executive Officer 12 Ai CLAIMS SOLuTIONS PLC  ANNuAL REPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2007",992,13,16,21,50,4,38,4,38,58,9,4,4,11,84,17.740862036514212,32.99078392621871,14.402751741012612,10.729469659326181,14.996057782796917,13.40577075098814,17.595238095238095,8.29848390739695,16.92669308720184,18.68,19.84,19.0,8.66,20.9,13.88,14.2,18.3,19.0

Don was  appointed to the Board in January 2005 and has  played a key role in developing Ai’s commercial  position as well as developing the Ai brand.   I wish Don much success in the future and thank  him for his contribution to the business. We also strengthened the wider management  team through three further appointments.   Ewan Moore joined us in January 2007 as  Group Financial Controller. Paul Davis from RSA  and Robin Yeung from CIS joined the business in  June 2007, as Head of Operations and Claims  Manager respectively.  Chief Executive’s Review  (continued) Ai actively invests in the development   of its staff. I reported last year that we had  developed the Talent Academy to provide   MBA type development in the workplace   under the mentoring of the Executive Directors.  The first group of nine successfully completed the  course and have all shown significant personal  development during the last 12 months, which  equipped most of them to take on new roles  within the business – showing a real return for   the investment we made. The programme  received public recognition in that Ai was short  listed for The Training Award at the British Insurer  Awards. A second group of employees joined   the academy during July 2007. Operational performance Referral levels increased overall by 24% during  the year. Intervention referrals increased by 30%  and non-fault referrals by 23%. Courtesy hires  reduced by 12%. Hire conversion levels were  consistent with the previous year across the   whole book.  Our hire durations reduced across both the  intervention and non-fault products from 20 days  in 2006 to 18 days in 2007. A key benefit of  the intervention product is a reduction in both  the daily rate and duration for hire vehicles and  it is important that we continue to reduce these  through ongoing improvements in process.   Our non-fault durations have been influenced  by disciplined repair supply chain management,  leading to a quicker turn round of repairs and  shortening of the time customers are parted from  their own vehicles.  In turn this leads to a reduction in Ai’s debtor  days as our claims are less likely to be disputed.   It is pleasing to see a further reduction in our  debtor days from 75 days to 55 days as a  testament to this. Our full time equivalent employees increased  by 15% against a background of a 24% growth  in referrals. Our efficiency levels will continue  to strengthen as we grow and through the  implementation of the new CARS system. Ai has shown resilience by quickly scaling   for growth in the period. The growth opportunities  in the market continue to be significant. We have  produced comprehensive and detailed plans to  ensure we are able to again scale up,  significantly and quickly, to absorb significant   new opportunities. The operational feedback from customers and  referrers continues to be excellent and we again  achieved over 95% satisfaction rating from our  own surveys. Outlook The successful launch of Ai Repair and Ai Law and  the progress achieved in the new divisions has  provided a broader customer base and pipeline  potential covering all areas of after accident  management. I believe Ai continues to be well  positioned to take advantage of opportunities as  they present themselves and adapt to the evolving  market of after accident care.  david Sandhu Chief Executive Ai has continued to strengthen the senior  management team during the year to   support the development of the business. david Sandhu Chief Executive Officer Business Overview Review of the Year Governance Financial Statements 15 ANNuAL REPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2007 Ai CLAIMS SOLuTIONS PLC ",666,7,7,12,31,2,25,2,24,35,8,4,1,2,49,15.28683556880278,42.33884252359664,12.201942374565327,10.410383556880278,12.356860407352215,12.231892697466467,14.681818181818182,7.371573770491802,15.33710200688057,16.53,32.36,16.2,8.27,17.8,12.66,13.6,16.4,17.0

18,359,AI CLAIM SOLUTIONS PLC  REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007.pdf,2007,0,AI Claim Solutions Plc,0,1,52,18,18," Restatement of prior period Results The annual report has been prepared using  accounting policies that are consistent with those  adopted in the statutory accounts for the period  ended 30 June 2006 other than the adoption of  FRS20 (Share based payments). Adoption of a  policy consistent with this standard is required in  accordance with united Kingdom best practice.  The impact of this policy is shown in note 25 to  the financial statements. Financial Overview The Group generated a pre-tax profit of   £1.001m in the year (2006: £0.865m),   an increase of 16%. Pre-tax profit before goodwill  amortisation and FRS 20 charge was £1.635m  (2006: £1.452m). Turnover of £34.3m reduced by 10% over  the previous year due to the cessation of a low  margin repair only contract in the previous period.  Hire revenue increased by 22% compared to the  previous year. These changes together with the  retention of higher margins through the Ai Repair  network and Ai Law improved gross margins to  30% from 24.8%. Administrative expenses of £9.1m increased  by 11% over the previous year reflecting a growth  in headcount of 15% and higher depreciation  charges. underlying referral levels increased by  24% across the whole business. The growth in  employees is disproportionate to the movement in  turnover due to the replacement of repair cases by  hire cases and the treatment of a major fleet repair  management contract as a fee based service. Interest Interest charges reduced by 47% to £213,000  (from £401,000) due to a 50% reduction in net  debt in the period of £1.9m to £1.9m. taxation The Group does not expect to pay Corporation  Tax in relation to the current year due to the  availability of tax losses brought forward  from prior periods. The tax charge in the year  benefited from the utilisation of unrecognised  losses brought forward. As a result of the Group  generating a profit in the year, the deferred   tax asset held in the balance sheet reduced   by £308,000 to £745,000. earnings per Share Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) increased by  0.40p to 1.13p (2006: 0.73p). Adjusted EPS,  which measures EPS before goodwill amortisation  and FRS 20 charge, increased by 0.47p to  2.16p (2006: 1.69p). Finance Director’s Review  dividends The dividends declared from reserves of  £295,000 reflects the payment of a final  dividend in relation to the previous period of  £153,000 (0.25p per share paid in January  2007) and an interim dividend for the current  period of £142,000 (0.23p per share paid  in May 2007). The Board have proposed  the payment of a final dividend for the year  of £178,000 (0.29p per share), payable on  7 January 2008 to shareholders on the share  register at 14 December 2007. under ‘FRS 21’ Events after the balance   sheet date only dividends declared in a financial  period are reflected in the financial statements   for that period. Accordingly, the proposed  payment of £178,000 is not reflected in these  Financial Statements. Cashflow and Working Capital The Group has generated a significant  improvement in its cash position during the year.  Net cash inflow from operating activities was  £3.95m (2006: £4.83m). The improvement is  attributable to an improvement in underlying  profits and focused management of billings   and collections. The Group’s strategy of working positively   with the insurance market to contain claims   costs has again assisted collection activity.   Our investment in working capital largely consists  of billed and unbilled receivables, the latter being  incomplete cases. The value of trading current  assets (excluding deferred tax) was £13.2m  at 30 June 2007, compared to £12.4m in the  previous year, an increase of 6%. Our trading  creditors (including VAT) provided £10.9m of  funding at 30 June 2007 compared to £8.6m  in the previous year, an increase of 27%. The  rate of debtor increase in relation to creditors  is due to the improvement in debtor days to 55  days from 75 days (27% reduction), a second  half increase in turnover of 15% compared to the  previous year and more beneficial supply terms  obtained in relation to hire compared to repair.  This means that Ai’s working capital requirement  is approximately 22 days revenue compared to  41 days in the previous period. Fixed assets Fixed asset additions of £1.6m reflects the  continued investment made in software for the  new Claims Administration and Recovery System  and employee growth related equipment costs.  The new system will enhance the data exchanges  we have with our partners and improve service  levels, efficiency and control over our entire  operation through streamlined processes and  workflow management. The system will be  brought into use in October 2007. Capital Structure and Financing Proceeds from share issues generated £12,000  during the year upon the exercise of share options. Net debt stands at £1.9m (2006: £3.8m).  Debt consists of a bank overdraft of £570,000  and structured finance in the form of a property  loan and computer leases. The Group has a  revolving overdraft funding facility with Yorkshire  Bank for up to £10m.  Interest charges on the overdraft and property  loan are variable, linked to Yorkshire Bank’s   base rate. Financial Risk management The Group does not enter into derivative  transactions nor trade in financial instruments.  The main risk arising from financial instruments is  interest rate risk, linked to movements in Yorkshire  Bank’s base rate.  The Group enters into contracts with customers,  for which vehicle provision and repair labour  prices may be prescribed for periods of up to 12  months. The Group secures supply arrangements  with rental companies and repairers to mitigate  the impact of volatility in prices over broadly  similar periods. In relation to non-fault hires, the  company is a subscriber to the ABI’s General  Terms of Agreement (GTA). GTA rates are agreed  between insurers and credit hire companies  annually. When pricing contracts the company  takes account of key potential sensitivities.  Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations from a mixture  of equity, bank borrowings and lease financing.  The Group borrows at floating rates of interest   1 – 2% above Yorkshire Bank base rate. No  interest rate caps or swaps are used to manage  exposure to interest rate fluctuations. liquidity Risk In order to maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient  funds are available for ongoing operations and  future developments, the Group uses a mixture of  short and long term debt finance. Implementation of International Financial  Reporting Standards As an AIM listed company the Group is required  to report under International Financial Reporting  Standards (IFRS) for the year ended 30 June  2008. The Group will issue re-stated financial  statements for the year ended 30 June 2007  during December 2007. peter j harrison  Group Finance Director Business Overview Review of the Year Governance Financial Statements 17 ANNuAL REPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2007 Ai CLAIMS SOLuTIONS PLC ",1102,7,7,18,31,8,27,8,26,44,33,27,22,26,35,16.167808873720137,47.120362457337905,12.275732423208193,11.62978099658703,13.104564846416388,11.419078498293512,16.58,8.803596313993173,16.15616582465906,17.06,30.13,17.1,8.45,19.5,12.95,13.0,16.9,17.0

An annual bonus scheme was established for 2006/07 based on achieving targeted levels of profit before taxation, goodwill amortisation, FRS20 charge  and exceptional items. This bonus scheme would pay up to a maximum of 100% of base salary if the defined profit before taxation measure reaches a  predetermined amount. Executive Directors participate in this scheme pro-rata to the period in which they are full time employees. The bonuses payable in  respect of the year are shown in note 3. As part of the Company’s longer term incentivisation arrangements, the Executive Directors are encouraged to acquire a meaningful equity stake in the  business. With this objective: 1. A grant of share options was made in October 2006 under previously existing share option arrangements. These share options are detailed in note 3. 2. A new share option scheme under the terms of the Equity Management Incentive ('EMI') scheme was approved by shareholders in December 2006 and  EMI share options were granted on 6 December, 2006; these EMI options are detailed in note 3. 3. A new Long Term Investment Plan (LTIP) was also approved by shareholders in December 2006. The first awards under this scheme are expected to be  made following the preliminary announcement of results for the year to June 2007.  The share options, EMI options and LTIP awards granted will vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject to the Executive Director remaining in post and  subject to the achievement of medium-term performance conditions which are shown in detail in note 3 to the Financial Statements.

Membership of the Committees are indicated on page 46. The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness whilst the role of management is to implement Board  policies on risk management and control. It should be recognised that the Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the  risk of failure to achieve the Group’s business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement and loss. The controls operated include, but are not limited to, the annual planning and budgeting process, a clearly defined organisational structure with authorisation  limits, reviews by senior management of weekly operating information and weekly and monthly financial data compared with planned activity. The Group has identified and manages its key business risks and has a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in place. Financial Instruments The Group’s financial instruments comprise some borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from   its operations. These are discussed in further detail on pages 35 – 37. Disabled Persons Policy Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event of   members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged.   It is the policy of the Group and Company that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to  that of other employees.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare financial  statements in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Financial Statements  are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with  sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other  irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements.

Accounting policies Basis of Accounting The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular accounting policies adopted  are described below. Accounting Convention The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. Consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings, together with the group’s share  of the net assets and results of associated undertakings and joint ventures. The Financial Statements of all group companies are adjusted, where necessary,   to ensure the use of consistent accounting policies. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The results of companies acquired or  disposed of are included in the group profit and loss account from or up to the date that control passes respectively. A separate profit and loss account for the Parent Company is not presented with the group Financial Statements as permitted by section 230 of the  Companies Act 1985. Goodwill Positive goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the aggregate of the fair values of that entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities.   Positive goodwill relating to acquisitions made since 1 January 1999 is shown in the balance sheet as an asset. Positive goodwill, where treated as   an asset, is amortised evenly over its estimated useful economic life subject to a maximum of 20 years. Periods between 12 and 20 years are used   for all existing goodwill. In addition to systematic amortisation, the book value is written down to recoverable amount when any impairment is identified. Tangible Fixed Assets Depreciation is provided on cost less residual value in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of assets in use. Assets in the course of  construction are not depreciated. Where there is evidence of impairment, fixed assets are written down to recoverable amount. Any such write down   would be charged to operating profit.  The rates of depreciation are as follows: Leasehold land and buildings   –  30 years Leasehold improvements  –  over the period of the lease Computer equipment and telephone systems   –  20% to 33% per annum Plant, fittings and equipment   –  20% per annum   Income Recognition Credit hire and repair income and income derived from other accident management services, are recognised on transactions which have completed during  the period, together with an appropriate proportion of income in respect of ongoing hires and repairs and work in progress at the period end, less claims  write offs and movements in provisions for under recovery from insurers. Income earned from insurers under the GTA penalty payments regime when claims  are settled late is only recognised when received. Income from referrals of personal injury cases to third parties are recognised in the period a referral is  made to the extent that a right to consideration arises. Turnover is recorded exclusive of VAT. Hire Purchase and Leases Assets held under hire purchase and finance lease agreements and the related obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair value of the assets  at the inception of the agreement. The amounts by which the hire purchase and lease payments exceed the recorded obligations are treated as finance  charges which are amortised over each agreement term to give a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation. Rental payments under  operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Pensions The Company and Group operate a defined contribution pension scheme for Directors and staff. The assets of the scheme are invested and managed  independently of the Company and Group. The pension cost charge represents the contributions paid and payable in the year. Deferred Taxation The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation  purposes. Full provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without discounting, on all timing differences that have arisen but not  reversed by the balance sheet date, unless such provision is not permitted by FRS 19. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded   as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax balances are not discounted. Dividends Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in current liabilities when the dividends are approved in general meeting prior to the  balance sheet date. Financial Assets Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet as and when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of   the instrument. 28 Ai CLAIMS SOLUTIONS PLC  ANNUAL RePORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007",776,6,7,25,10,14,9,14,9,21,9,4,2,20,14,16.865531603945925,33.13193606138108,13.96524735111436,10.4993732334673,14.580354402630618,13.884296675191813,16.942857142857143,8.157373547679942,17.044455618883767,14.82,38.35,13.9,8.32,16.0,13.81,13.0,15.6,14.0
30,359,AI CLAIM SOLUTIONS PLC  REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007.pdf,2007,0,AI Claim Solutions Plc,0,1,52,30,30," Share Based Payments The Group has applied the requirements of FRS20, Share Based Payments. The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain directors and  employees. The fair value of these payments is expensed over the vesting period based on an estimate of when shares will eventually vest and adjusted for  the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.  Fair value is measured by the Black Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the  effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 2. Analysis of turnover, operating profit and net assets The Directors consider that the activities of the Group represent a single business segment, being the provision of an outsourced claims management solution  to motor insurers. The location and destination of all turnover, operating profits and net assets was the United Kingdom. 3.

Financial assets and liabilities The Board policy on derivatives and financial instruments is explained in the Finance Director’s Review. The only financial asset, excluding debtors due within one year, material enough to warrant disclosure is cash at bank, which attracts interest at rates which  vary with prevailing bank rates. All amounts are held in sterling. In the opinion of the directors, the fair value of these financial assets and the Group’s  financial liabilities is not materially different to their book value. The bank overdraft bears interest at variable rates linked to Yorkshire Bank’s base rate. The total amount of the Group’s committed facilities available as at 30 June 2007 was up to a maximum of £10 million expiring in one year or less   (2006: £10m expiring in one year or less). The hire purchase and finance lease arrangements are all at fixed rates of interest. The weighted average rate is 4.42%. The majority of hire purchase and  finance lease arrangements are three years. 17.
